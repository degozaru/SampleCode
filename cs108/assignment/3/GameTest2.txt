**PRINT ALL ACTIONS AND COMPARE WITH EXPECTED VALUES**

Step 1) Test constructors

	make new dog, cat, and alien using default constructors
	make new dog using constructor with health 60 happiness 75 weight 90
	make new cat using constructor with health 110, happiness 50, weight 50 (This should call a default constructor)
	make new alien using constructor with health -10, happiness 50, weight 50 (This should call a default constructor)

Step 2) Checking these values.

	print the value of all the constructed instanced classes

Step 3) Changing values

	modify hapiness of dog by -50
	print happiness
	modify sadness by 50 (should throw)
	modify modify health by 100 (should throw)
	modify health by -100 (should throw)

Step 4) test sad noise

	call sad noise for all types of subclasses

Step 5) test happy noise
	
	Call the happy method for everyone
